# DRDO-DRUSE-PROJECT
We created this python file to run on a land rover we named SpySee. It was our project for DRDO DRUSE competion.
This file runs on a Raspberry pi 3b remotely through Jetbeans Pycharm.

The code has various hardware component modules like gps, servo motors and face and object detection of multiple objects with the help of deep learning.
